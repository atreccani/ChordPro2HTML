# ChordPro2HTML
Simple command line converter from ChordPro (lyrics + chords) to HTML (hypertext markup language).


## Synopsis

ChordPro2HTML allow to convert easily ChordPro files into HTML.
ChordPro2HTML doesn't care at all about editing, but simply aims to facilitate conversion of an archive of (editable) chord 
pro file into a web style hypertext to be browsed, viewed and shared easily.

## Motivation

Having lots of chordpro file in a single directory I was looking for a simple tool to convert all them into hypertext
(one page for each chordpro file) so that I can put them, for example in a shared folder, and simply view them without 
installing any additional software when playing.
